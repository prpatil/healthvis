\title{Create a interactive plot of a cox proportional hazards model}
\usage{
survivalVis(cobj, data, group = NULL, group.names = "",
  line.col = "deepskyblue", plot.title = "Survival Plot", day.max = 1000)
}
\arguments{
\item{cobj}{An object created with a call to \code{\link{coxph}}}

\item{data}{The dataset used to creat the coxph object.}

\item{group}{The covariate in model by which to group. If NULL, no grouping.}

\item{group.names}{Names of groups to appear on legend. Default empty string for no grouping.}

\item{line.col}{Vector of names of colors to use for each group. Length must equal number of groups. Default single string for no grouping.}

\item{plot.title}{The title of the plot to appear on the HTML page}
}
\description{
\code{survivalVis} plots a cox proportional hazards model and uses
the covariate information to update the figure in real time. Users
can specify a grouping covariate to display a group comparison.
}
\note{
Interaction terms are not fully supported currently. The figure will plot, but transitions may be inaccurate.

\examples{
# Uses the survival package
library(survival)
# Set trt and prior as factors so they are treated as such
veteran$trt <- as.factor(veteran$trt)
veteran$prior <- as.factor(veteran$prior)
cobj <- coxph(Surv(time, status)~trt+age+celltype+prior, data=veteran)
survivalVis(cobj, data=veteran, plot.title="Veteran Survival Data", group="trt", group.names=c("Treatment", "No Treatment"), line.col=c("#E495A5","#39BEB1"))
